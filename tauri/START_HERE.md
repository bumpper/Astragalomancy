## Common First Steps

### Making Your First Change

1. **Edit the frontend:**
   - Open `src/index.html` in your editor
   - Make a change (e.g., modify a color in the `<style>` section)
   - Save the file
   - The app will automatically reload with your changes!

2. **Test your change:**
   - Verify it looks correct in the application window
   - Try different features to ensure nothing broke

### Building Your First Installer

1. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   
   Or use the quick script:
   ```bash
   quick-build.bat
   ```

2. **Find your installer:**
   - Windows: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi/` or `nsis/`
   - macOS: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/`
   - Linux: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/` or `rpm/`

3. **Test the installer:**
   - Install it on your system
   - Run the installed application
   - Verify all features work

## Project Structure Overview

```
astragalomancy/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                    # Frontend files (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src-tauri/             # Backend files (Rust, Tauri config)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json           # Node.js configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ quick-dev.bat          # Quick development script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ quick-build.bat        # Quick build script
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *.md                   # Documentation files
```

**Key Files:**
- `src/index.html` - Main application interface
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` - Application configuration
- `src-tauri/src/main.rs` - Rust backend entry point

## Development Workflow

### Typical Session

1. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Make changes to files in `src/`**

3. **Changes auto-reload in the application**

4. **Test your changes**

5. **Stop server with Ctrl+C**

### Before Committing

- [ ] Test the application works
- [ ] Verify all features function correctly
- [ ] Check for console errors
- [ ] Test dark mode toggle
- [ ] Verify help documentation loads

## Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start

**Error: "cargo not found"**
- Install Rust: https://rustup.rs/
- Restart terminal

**Error: "node not found"**
- Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/
- Restart terminal

**Error: Build fails**
- Check you have platform-specific dependencies
- See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for details

### First Build Takes Forever

**This is normal!**
- First build: 10-30 minutes (compiling Rust dependencies)
- Subsequent builds: 1-5 minutes
- Development mode: Much faster

### Images Don't Load

- Verify all PNG files are in `src/` directory
- Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure `help_files/` directory is present

## Key Commands Reference

### Development
```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev         # Start development server
quick-dev.bat       # Quick development start (Windows)
```

### Building
```bash
npm run build           # Build for current platform
npm run build:windows   # Build for Windows
npm run build:macos     # Build for macOS
npm run build:linux     # Build for Linux
quick-build.bat         # Quick build (Windows)
```

### Maintenance
```bash
cargo clean         # Clean Rust build (in src-tauri/)
npm install         # Reinstall dependencies
rustup update       # Update Rust
```

## Important Notes

### Icons
‚ö†Ô∏è **The project needs icons created!**
- Required in `src-tauri/icons/`
- See [BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md](BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for details
- Can use favicon.ico as a starting point

### First Build
‚è±Ô∏è **Be patient with the first build!**
- Takes 10-30 minutes to compile Rust dependencies
- Subsequent builds are much faster
- This is normal for Rust/Tauri projects

### Development Mode
üîÑ **Hot reload is enabled in dev mode**
- Changes to HTML/CSS/JS auto-reload
- No need to restart the server
- Very fast iteration cycle

## Success Checklist

You're ready to develop when:
- [ ] `npm run dev` opens the application
- [ ] You can enter a question and cast bones
- [ ] Results display with images and text
- [ ] Dark mode toggle works
- [ ] Help button opens documentation
- [ ] Changes to `src/index.html` auto-reload

## Next Steps

Now that you're set up:

1. **Explore the code** in `src/index.html`
2. **Try making a small change** and see it reload
3. **Read the help documentation** in the app
4. **Build an installer** with `npm run build`
5. **Review other documentation** for deeper understanding

## Welcome Aboard!

You're now ready to work with Astragalomancy! Whether you're using it for divination or developing new features, we hope you enjoy this ancient practice brought to modern technology.

**Happy divining! üé≤**
