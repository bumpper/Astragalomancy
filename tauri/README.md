## About Astragalomancy

Astragalomancy is an ancient form of divination using knuckle bones (astragali) from sheep. This practice dates back to ancient Greece and was used to seek guidance from the gods. The application simulates casting 5 knuckle bones, each landing on one of four sides (valued 1, 3, 4, or 6), producing 56 possible combinations, each with its own divine interpretation.

- `128x128.png`
- `128x128@2x.png`
- `icon.icns` (macOS)
- `icon.ico` (Windows)

You can use online tools or image editors to create these from the favicon.ico or any PNG image.

### Build Errors
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed
2. Clear the build cache: `cargo clean` in the `src-tauri` directory
3. Update Rust: `rustup update`
4. Update dependencies: `cargo update` in the `src-tauri` directory

### Display Issues
If images don't display correctly:
1. Ensure all PNG files are in the `src/` directory
2. Check that the `help_files/` directory is properly copied
3. Verify file paths in the HTML are correct

## Historical Context

Astragalomancy was practiced in ancient Greece and Rome, where knuckle bones (astragali) from sheep or goats were used for divination. Each bone has four distinct sides with different values (1, 3, 4, and 6), and the combination of five bones produces 56 possible outcomes. Each outcome was associated with a deity or concept and carried a specific interpretation.

This application preserves these ancient interpretations, allowing modern users to experience this historical divination practice.
